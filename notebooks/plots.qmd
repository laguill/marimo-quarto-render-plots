```python {.marimo}
import marimo as mo

```

```python {.marimo}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

```

Output a plot object, such as an axis or figure, to see the plot.

```python {.marimo}
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 10)
plt.plot(x, x**2)
plt.gca()
```

Calling `show()` methods displays the plot in the console area, which can be
helpful for debugging because console outputs do not show up in the "app" preview.

```python {.marimo}
plt.plot(x, x**3)
plt.show()
```
